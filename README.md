Codes in LAMMPS, Python and Houdini for the simulation of Pi+ and Sigma+
The two script in LAMMPS, pi.lammps and in sigma.lammps, are used to simulate the two structure in their helical configuration.
With the two scripts in Python adf_pi.py and adf_sigma.py it is possible to calculate and represent the angle distribution along a single chain and to compare the distributions along the same chain for two different frames.
With the two scripts poisson_pi.py and poisson_sigma.py it is possible to calculate and represent the Poisson's ratio for the two structures.
