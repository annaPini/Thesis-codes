In this repository are contained all the scripts in LAMMPS, Python and Houdini necessary to carry out the simulation of Pi+ and Sigma+ structures. 
..* In pi_bar.lammps and in sigma_bar.lammps the box is relaxed with a barostat, while in pi_no_bar.lammps and in sigma_no_bar.lammps an energy minimization is used. This second approach seems to give better results.
..* The script L_average.py is the same for Pi+ and Sigma+. Only the total number of beads must be changed.
