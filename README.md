In this repository are contained all the scripts in LAMMPS, Python and Houdini necessary to carry out the simulation of Pi+ and Sigma+ entanglements. In the main branch there is only the file in Houdini with the initial coordinates and the of the two structures. In the branch "heat map and energy" there are the script in Python for the calculation of the angles along the chains and of the interaction energy. In the branch "Poisson's ratio" there are the script to calculate the length of the box at the end of the trajectory, save it into a file and then calculate and plot the Poisson's ratio. In the branch "script in lammps" there are all the scripts and the configuration files necessary to run the simulations performed in this work. Finally in the branch "data" there are the files with the sizes of the box at the end oneach trajectory and the interaction energies. There is not a file with the Poisson's ratio because this quantity has been calculated starting from the sizes of the box in the directions perpendicular to that in which a stress is applied.
